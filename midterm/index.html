            <h2 class="title"> Life of a Starfish</h2>
            <p>How long do sea stars live?
                Again, with so many species of sea stars, it’s hard to generalize lifespan. On average, they can live 35 years in the wild. In captivity, most live 5-10 years when well cared for.
                
                Are sea stars endangered?
                Like many marine animals, sea stars are threatened by rising ocean temperatures, ocean acidification and pollution, and other human activity. A disease called sea star wasting disease has caused massive population losses since 2013. It has affected multiple species from New England to Mexico to Alaska. This disease is made worse by rising water temperatures, like those caused by global climate change.
                
                The loss of any species causes a ripple effect in its habitat . For example, the endangered sunflower star helped control sea urchin populations in kelp forests on the Pacific coast. Without their natural predator, sea urchin populations are exploding and overgrazing the kelp. This in turn harms all the organisms, or living things, that rely on the kelp forests.
                
                Do sea stars make good pets?
                Sea stars are sensitive to sudden changes in salinity, oxygen, pH levels and can be difficult to care for at home. Some popular fish, like puffers and triggerfish, will eat sea stars and don’t make good companions. Always research an animal’s unique needs and whether they are captive-bred or wild-caught before deciding to get a new pet.

            <p class="title"> THREATS </p>
            <p> Starfish may be preyed on by conspecifics, sea anemones,[72] other starfish species, tritons, crabs, fish, gulls and sea otters.[37][69][73][74] Their first lines of defence are the saponins present in their body walls, which have unpleasant flavours.[75] Some starfish such as Astropecten polyacanthus also include powerful toxins such as tetrodotoxin among their chemical armoury, and the slime star can ooze out large quantities of repellent mucus. They also have body armour in the form of hard plates and spines.[76] The crown-of-thorns starfish is particularly unattractive to potential predators, being heavily defended by sharp spines, laced with toxins and sometimes with bright warning colours.[77] Other species protect their vulnerable tube feet and arm tips by lining their ambulacral grooves with spines and heavily plating their extremities </p>

                The water vascular system of the starfish is a hydraulic system made up of a network of fluid-filled canals and is concerned with locomotion, adhesion, food manipulation and gas exchange. Water enters the system through the madreporite, a porous, often conspicuous, sieve-like ossicle on the aboral surface. It is linked through a stone canal, often lined with calcareous material, to a ring canal around the mouth opening. A set of radial canals leads off this; one radial canal runs along the ambulacral groove in each arm. There are short lateral canals branching off alternately to either side of the radial canal, each ending in an ampulla

                <h3 class="title"> Facts About Starfish</h3>
                <div class="minititles">
               <p> 1. They have no brain and no blood. Starfish use filtered sea water to pump nutrients through their nervous system.</p>
               <p> 2. They can be really heavy. At least for something of their small size, sea stars can weigh up to 11 pounds.</p>
               <p> 3. They have a lot of birthdays! The average lifespan of a sea star is 35 years.</p>
               <p> 4. A Starfish in not a fish. They’re actually related to sand dollars and sea urchins</p>
               <p> 5. There are around 2,000 species of sea star. They live in cold and warm climates all over the world.</p>
